The principle beneficiary of the evening will be the Timor-Leste Dental Program which engages Australian volunteer dentists to provide free dental health services in the rural villages of Timor-Leste, in partnership with Carmelite Sisters in Maubara. The TLDP program was established ten years ago under the auspices of Rotary Australia World Community Service (RAWCS), while some residual funds will be used to support other Rotary projects.\n\nThe event was a huge success with us raising over $80,000 for the RAWCS project Timor Leste Dental Program (TLDP) and other Rotary projects. The TLDP was initiated by Chatswood Rotary in 2003 with Dick Abbott and Peter Kindred and provides volunteer dentists and equipment on a regular basis in Maubara, on Timor Leste\u2019s north coast. \n\nOur donation enabled the TLDP to but a new Toyota LWB Troopie 4WD to transport the dentists and their supplies up into the highlands where local people receive free dental treatment.\n\nI am responsible for the media, creative and technical parts of the projects, including slideshows, flyers, brochures, tickets, websites, stage and program.",

That's one of the things that's so remarkable about Budi. He demonstrates not only mastery for his core role, but also the ability to take on projects that are both difficult and critical to the company's growth.\n\nThis rare mix of great leadership and awesome voice when singing mandarin song, Budi sets a great example for the rest of the team, and that explains why everyone loves working with him. I certainly miss working with him and I have only optimistic predictions for his career and entrepreneurship trajectory.",
