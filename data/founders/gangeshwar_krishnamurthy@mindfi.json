            "description": "In this work, we have developed an end-to-end system for Spoken Term Detection in Audio. Query by Example is a task of searching for query audio within long corpus audio. The key aspect of QbE-STD is to enable multi-lingual and multi-speaker audio search. Due to variations in speaking rates, a non-linear fluctuation occurs in speech pattern versus time axis. To overcome this challenge we implemented a Dynamic Time Warping based algorithm called SPRING which is suitable to monitor streaming data for patterns. For feature representation, we investigated various features of an audio such as MFCC, Filter Bank, Bottleneck and found that Bottleneck features are stable to variations in the multi-speaker environment. The DTW-SPRING is performed on these features of both the query audio and corpus audio. The distance matrix computed by SPRING shows the occurrences of the query in the corpus. Figure on the project site shows the heatmap plot of the distance matrix calculated by SPRING for a corpus audio with four occurrences of the query audio. After this phase, we built a Web-based GUI for the users to interact with the system. The user can record or select the query audio from the system and search for its occurrences in the corpus audio. This system can be extended into an audio search engine by indexing multiple corpus files across clusters.",

            "description": "In this work, we investigated a method of using Sequence to Sequence learning model to punctuate a sequence of unpunctuated text from Automatic Speech Recognition system. The aim of this work is to preserve the contextual meaning of a sequence of text which might be a spoken paragraph from ASR. This direction of SUD has not yet been explored in the previous works as far as our knowledge is concerned. It can be intuitively understood that the context of the previous sentence can improve the occurrence of the next sentence boundary. Towards this goal, we are currently investigating the use of sequence models, specifically sequence to sequence (Encoder-Decoder based) model. The dataset was prepared from the Wikipedia articles dump. Here, every paragraph is a sample in the dataset and is considered to be a sequence of text to be punctuated. The sequence length of a paragraph varies from 75 to 750. Around 1.3 million paragraphs were prepared and pre-processed for the task. In the first stage of the pre-processing, only text and periods(.) are retained and all other symbols and punctuations are removed. \n\nThe model is two layered on encoder side with bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. And the decoder is two layered with attention mechanism and uses LSTM cells. The attention mechanism used in this experiment was \"bahdanau\" additive attention as introduced in this ICLR 2015 paper. Alternatively, we will be using the \"luong\" multiplicative attention for comparison. The vocab size was chosen to be 160k and input size of the model is 75. The word embeddings are used as features with dimension size of 300. Every paragraph is sent as a mini batch of input length 75 with variable batch size (depending on the number of words in that paragraph). We used the concept of Truncated BPTT to help the model in remembering the text seen in the previous batches.",
