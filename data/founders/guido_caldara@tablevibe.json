We worked closely together on the Le Wagon Bali team and he is one of the most enjoyable people I've gotten a chance to work with. Very insightful and understanding, very skilled and knowledgable, and very organised in the way he thinks and manages. I know that anyone who works with Guido will end up making a new friend as well - his character is filled with integrity and empathy, making it easy to connect with him personally. Time and time again, I see how students of the bootcamp respond to Guido and it directly reflects that he is an outstanding human being. "
