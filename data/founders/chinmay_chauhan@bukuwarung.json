        "Ellery Jose, MTM\n\n\n\nI was very fortunate to have had the chance to work with Chinmay for the second time, this time in his capacity as BukuWarung's Co-Founder/President and overall Technology leader. He oversaw the scaling up of both the Product, Design and Engineering teams, bringing top-notch people to lead these teams. He is as I remember him from Grab, a very smart product-oriented technical person. He is thoughtful, equally challenging in his questions to his leaders but also deeply empathetic to all who work with him. He is also decisive, can cut through the noise and provide clear direction.",
        "Stuart Thornton\n\n\n\nIve worked with Chinmay in a few capacities. Chinmay was an angel investor in hoolah where he clearly demonstrated his strategic and tactical capabilities with a professional due diligence into our business. This tested our knowledge of the business and contributed to our learning. His capabilities with product leadership was also evident as we began to work with him on more tactical opportunities outside of investment. Ive also been honored to try and return the favour as he set on his startup course - not that he has needed it at all. Smart, sharp, dependable I know success is around the corner for his latest venture. "
