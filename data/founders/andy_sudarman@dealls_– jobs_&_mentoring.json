    "summary": "I'm a graduate of Universitas Indonesia and Harvard Law School, and the first-ever Indonesian to have spoken at the Harvard Law's commencement. Last year, I built the app that won \"Indonesia's Best App of 2021 by GooglePlay\" \u2013 the first-ever winner from Indonesia. I am now pursuing life's calling to change Indonesian job-seeking and mentoring landscape. We grew from 0 to 2+ million users in 10 months, with no funding & staying profitable.\n\nLife is all about momentum. Join our movement to revolutionize job-seeking and mentoring industries in Indonesia\u00a0\u2013 www.usedeall.com/career\n\n\u2013\n\n\"Andhika has a long list of achievements. Yet, at first glance, the combination of achievements on Andhika's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't make a lot of sense. The path to where he is today was not linear: (1) at one point he was the only operator outside of Java and the youngest in the then-largest gaming community in the country (Indogamers), (2) another time he won a silver medal Taekwondo competition. (3) He published two educational books aiming to share know-how to off-the-grid students in Indonesia, (4) conducted an internship in an art museum in China and (5) legal firm in Singapore, before later (6) went to a one-year student exchange program to Japan. (7) Andhika also founded an award-winning non-profit organization and (8) was awarded Indonesia's National Most Outstanding Student by the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education (multi-round competitions, finishing 1st place of 5+ million). (9) After passing the Indonesian bar exam and becoming Indonesian-qualified, he spent nearly three years as a corporate lawyer doing project finance and (10) worked in an Indonesian conglomerate as the chairman's assistant (business side). Spent a \u2018short\u2019 9-month in Harvard, he graduated as (11) Harvard Law School's 2020 Dean's Award recipient, (12) Harvard Law School's 2020 Class Marshal Elect, and (13) Harvard Law School\u2019s 2020 Commencement Ceremony Closing Speaker.\n\nIn an interview, he responded, \"Everything I've been interested in, I've done well. I believe in continuous excellence and I want to be proud of what I have done. When I pursue something, I do it with a strong work ethic and an intense drive to succeed. I'm going to take it seriously and I'm going to excel.\"",

            "description": "MIT FinTech Challenge 2020 Hackaton was really more of a Dataton. The objective of the run was to build a model capable of detecting spoofing activities. Initially it felt like being asked to find a needle in the ocean; among the daily millions of commands-turned activities we must figure out which ones of them are spoofs. Someone sitting in Bali could be sipping cocktails and inserted their illegal slips\u2014and we needed to figure out which is which, among the millions of it.\n\nOur team researched, brainstormed, and fiercely debated on the best approach our team should take. Instead of the prizes, our team was instead motivated by our sole goal to create the best model someone could ever thought of. We believed our solution must be unique\u2014best if it\u2019s something something easy to build, explain, and implement. Clearly it wasn\u2019t easy, but not impossible either. After hours-long debate, we were convinced that a monitoring tool with multiple layers of flagging systems is the way to go. Intent is difficult to tell\u2014but our MRMS (mens rea metering system) measures spectrum of possibilities instead of utilizing the traditional binary system most other teams thought of. Second-level \u201c70%\u201d bar is first alerted to the direct supervisor before the ticket goes to the MD, and later the compliance team. If someone repeatedly walks into the holes we dig, we could argue better they had ill intentions. The next challenge was to provide non-quantitative ways including policies and procedures (e.g. leveraging psychology or behavioral economics) to tackle the US spoofing issues. From data, we now needed to jump into law, econs, and psychology\u2014all this, in 24 hours.\n\nOn the second day, our team delivered the model using multiple analytics techniques including unsupervised machine learning. We were awarded 2nd RU. Other teams had 7 members (upper limit) and we only had 3 members. We were strong. We learned a lot. It was absolutely one of my best 24 hours."
