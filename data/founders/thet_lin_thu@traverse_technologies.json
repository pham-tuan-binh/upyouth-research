I am very impressed with his capability to analyze and present technical, commercial, environmental, and sustainability aspects of the projects and transfer them to an integrated document. Not to mention his expertise in financial analysis. His intelligence allows him to comprehend many financial elements of energy project and able to evaluate different financial models in a relatively short time. He always provides accurate and precise recommendations to mitigate risks at early stage.     \r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to have him in a team.
