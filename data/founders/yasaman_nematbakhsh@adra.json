With Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education becoming required in OECD countries, most schools struggle to introduce biotechnology to their students due to high equipment cost and troublesome experiment preparation. 42LAB solves this problem by providing a portable modular biotech equipment for students to conduct experiments as well as a companion app which serves as an electronic manual for students and a management tool for teachers. Its vision is to bring biotech experience to every student like what Raspberry pi does for computer science.\n\nKey Contributions:\n-Led development of 200+ hours of research informed pedagogy from pre-school (early childhood) to secondary school level according to local and international curriculum (IB & NGSS).\n-Directed scientific research and development (R&D) to evaluate adaptability of developed lesson plans for each level.\n-Planned executions in the company.\n-Raised pre-seed funding and grants.\n-Directed sales and customer development, conducted market research, and promoted our brand through presentations, events and exhibitions.\n-Established strategic partnerships with key players in the education sector such as Marshall Cavendish Education and Popular Bookstore.\n\n-Second Runner Up in SheLovesTech (Singapore, 2019)\n-Top 5 Finalist, Startcon (Hong Kong 2019)\n-Top 5 Finalist, Global Edtech (Education Technology) Innovation Startup Competition (Abu Dhabi, 2018)\n-Winner in Project Alpha Singapore Startup Competition (Singapore 2018)\n-Top 8 Finalist, Cocoon 60th Pitch Night (Hong Kong, 2018)\n-Top 8 Finalist, Seedstars Singapore Region (Singapore, 2018)",

        "Sakthivel Baskaran\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Yasaman at Adra, reporting to her directly for my AI & ML internship. Despite the short duration of the internship, I got to see many of her very admirable qualities, as a Leader and a Technologist. She showed genuine care and concern in the personal development of those under her charge and would go out of the way to help them get closer to reaching their respective goals and aspirations. In her team no one was left feeling like a tiny cog in a bigger machine but rather everyone was motivated by her direction and vision to bring Adra to greater heights. I am confident anyone would be lucky to work together with Yasaman at any level. Wishing for greater things for Adra and Yasaman"
