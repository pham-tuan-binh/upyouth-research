This is the root to many major social issues we see today - juvenile delinquency, single-parent homes, broken families, depression, etc.\n\nOur vision is to empower every serious relationship to become a couple that's forever in love, inspiring a world where broken families and unhappy children cease to exist. We will materialize this for the next generation of young couples (over 1B of them) and in doing so mitigate some of the world's most major social problems in both developing and developed societies today.\n\nWe are always looking for highly capable individuals who equally passionate for our vision, and are hungry enough to make it a reality.

More importantly, I'm extremely honored to have been part of the awesome Dynamo team which has done amazing work for its clients thus far. \n\nDynamo PR was founded out of a desire to create an agency that can generate new ideas; an agency that can translate those ideas into effective, exciting communications campaigns; and an agency that delivers campaigns designed to drive customers\u2019 business objectives whether that is through raising funds, targeted social media and adspend, or traditional PR.\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, we have a creative, vibrant team that focus on tech, mobile, startup, consumer, crowdfunding, and digital clients, all while delivering 360 degree service.\n\nWe like to do things differently, delivering award winning creative campaigns for our clients, offering services outside of traditional PR (reseller/distributer work, product development, branding and messaging, VC training, etc.), and simply being the best at giving the media what they want, when they want.",
