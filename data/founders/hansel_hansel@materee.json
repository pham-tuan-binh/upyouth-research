    "summary": "Managing, expanding, and building successful businesses are difficult.  \n\nWith a foundation in working at Procter & Gamble and starting up Glico Wings, I aim to bring expertise to companies or individuals who are looking to start a new business, enter new market or region, introduce new products, or improve their current business performance.\n\nI believe that a company will become successful if they have a sound strategy with proper business infrastructure. Having grass-root understanding of the market situation and customer needs as well as being data-driven in making business decisions will enable a company to create a sound strategy. Furthermore, having appropriate business infrastructure consisting of suitable organization planning & development and robust system to support operations will allow a company to excellently execute their strategy.\n\nMy peers, managers, and directors have consistently identified my top strengths as: (1) being able to always think and act from the company\u2019s best interests; (2) being able to quickly gain trust and efficiently manage stakeholders both inside and outside the organization; (3) being very logical and data-driven.\n\nSpecialties include: Go-to-market strategy, managing and leading across function within multi-cultural organizations, technology product development, operations management and improvement, organizational planning and development, navigating business uncertainties in emerging country",
