        "Michel Farah\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s rare that you come across standout talent like Manish. \nManish expertly filled the role of  coordinator for my company\u2019s strategic alliance with a major Indian partner.\nI was particularly impressed by Manish\u2019s ability to handle even the toughest creases in a new relationship\u2014effortlessly. That skill often takes years to develop as a service professional, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him. \nManish made sure to bridge the gap between East and West, and tried hard to explain the rules of cricket to the rest of our team.\nAs president of Mitchell Group Manish earns my highest recommendation.
