Despite not having previous imaging experience, I mastered the Android Camera2 API and was in charge of dramatically improving the speed, stability and feature set of the stock Camera app shipped on the Essential Phone. Working internally with image quality and design teams and externally with vendors, I drove product direction beyond delivering quality code.\n\nLiaising directly with our software partners, ArcSoft and Qualcomm, I owned and built four critical camera features:\n- Portrait mode\n- Dual-camera image fusion for noise reduction and sharpness\n- HDR (High Dynamic Range) captures\n- Auto-HDR scene detection\n\nI was also the DRI for a laundry list of core features, including:\n- Flash captures\n- Burst mode\n- Tap to focus/expose\n- Digital zoom\n- Face detection\n- Multiple video resolutions (4K, HD and HD 60)\n- Slow-mo video\n- Video snapshots\n- Responding to requests from external apps for a photo or video capture\n\nOn the engineering front, I re-architected the code to improve resource management and thread safety. I conceived constructs allowing images to be safely processed by multiple threads simultaneously, and for asynchronous management of camera assets and the preview stream. Our work shrunk the crash rate from 1.4% to 0.1% of sessions.\n\nFrom being initially panned by reviewers, our rapid updates made the phone competitive. TechCrunch even praised: \"Essential Phone is the best deal in smartphones thanks to camera updates\" (Nov 1, 2017).",
