I worked under him closely as Business Development, and learned to adapt quickly to the pressures of working in a startup. He built Kalibrr by recruiting and enabling the best and the brightest talents in the PH, and hopes to give the same impact to other companies who need talent. He's a leader and mentor to the team, who shows exceptional charisma and drive to bring the organization forward. ",
