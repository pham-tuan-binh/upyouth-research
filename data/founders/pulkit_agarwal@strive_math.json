So here it is: I'm finally going to do it as my profession. \n\nThere is a lot to be fixed in education: low teacher salaries, low access to education, education being behind industry, high student suicide rates, high student depression rate and high cost of education... So the question simply remains: \"Can I make an impact here?\" I've been blessed to have received high quality education throughout my life, so I see it as my responsibility to do my part. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me if this resonates with you :) ",
