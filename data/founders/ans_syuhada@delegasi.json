        "Anwari Ilman\n\n\n\nWe worked together at NoLimit to create a social media analytics dashboard. While coming from a different approach to deliver the job, I was awed by Anshor's approach, technical skills, and dedication to fulfil the need of showing data correctly & quickly in the dashboard. His skills and knowledge has been proven with complex problems such as scraping, storing, and retrieving enormous scale of data (millions of entries per day) in our open-source implementation of Big Data analytical platform.\n\nAnshor's critical approach to solving technical problems are a exemplary. He is a highly curious person, always looking for new & better ways to improve something. It was a great delight to have him helping me in the job. Outside the work environment, Anshor is a very trustable friend and a great fun to be with. Cheers!"
