The\ngovernment has taken a targeted approach to solve the problem of water pollution and\nenvironmental degradation by encouraging overseas participation and has placed\ngreater emphasis on quality of water. Particularly, given that domestic Chinese firms\nlack the experience, scale and technological knowhow to treat the wastewater to meet\nChina\u2019s water quality standard and cater to the entire market, we explore how foreign\ncompanies in the wastewater treatment industry stand to gain by pouncing onto this\nmarket opportunity. We analyze the various structures and routes for these firms to\nenter the Chinese market and we give our recommendation on which one to choose and\non how to establish a successful business model.",
