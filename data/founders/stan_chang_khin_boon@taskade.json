We wanted a better way to collaborate on team projects, and yet the right tool simply didn't exist. So we decided to build one. \n\nTaskade is everything we\u2019ve ever wanted in a team productivity tool. One that would let you ideate, organize, and manage tasks together in real-time \u2014 and yet was no more difficult to use than a pen and paper.\n\nNo steep learning curves. No complex interface. No maze of functionality you might never find your way out of. Taskade makes team productivity simple, flexible, and smart.\n\n\u2014 https://www.taskade.com",
