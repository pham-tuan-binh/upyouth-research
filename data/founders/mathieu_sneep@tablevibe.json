Mathieu worked tirelessly to lead and build a successful App Developer sales team at Google. I would recommend Mathieu for any position, as he naturally rises to the occasion when presented with something he is passionate about.",

He is open for feedback and values the input of the people he works with. His helpful and open approach combined with a professional, yet amicable, attitude is what makes him and his team excell. I had the pleasure to see up close how Mathieu consistently reaches any goal he puts in front of himself. He is not one to accept the status quo, and combined with his entrepreneurial spirit he challenges himself beyond what is necessary to continuously outperforms targets. As a friend and a colleague, I recommend Mathieu to anyone looking to grow a business."
