We had several conversations, and I was blown away with the inspired ingenuity behind Alem Health's vision and even more impressed by their achievements in remote, difficult markets. What I appreciated most about Aschkan was that he was willing to make spur of the moment connections and share lessons he had learned. I discovered that Alem Health sees challenges as opportunities, and that the people behind the company eat crazy obstacles for breakfast as they engineer simple and effective solutions that work in really well in Africa.
