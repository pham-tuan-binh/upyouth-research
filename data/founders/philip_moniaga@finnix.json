            "description": "This research implements an artificial intelligence for bot on The Unreal Tournament 2004.\nThe Artificial Intelligence is developed using The Pogamut framework and The Java\nprogramming language.\nThe Artificial Neural Network is used as an artificial intelligence\nfor the bot to decides which actions should be taken by the bot.\nThe bot can choose to shoot opponents, to take opponent's flag, to take own's flag, back to it's own base, move to opponent's base, to flee from the opponent, to change weapons, or to take items.\nDecisions are made based on the health point, the distance to the flag, the distance from opponents, and the other conditions from environment in the game.\nThe Genetic Algorithms is used to train the Artificial Neural Network.\nResults from the experiments show that the bot sometimes takes decision exactly like\nthe behaviour of human player.",
