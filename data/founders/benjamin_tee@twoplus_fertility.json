We present a power-efficient skin-inspired mechanoreceptor with a flexible organic transistor circuit that transduces pressure into digital frequency signals directly. The output frequency ranges between 0 and 200 hertz, with a sublinear response to increasing force stimuli that mimics slow-adapting skin mechanoreceptors. The output of the sensors was further used to stimulate optogenetically\nengineered mouse somatosensory neurons of mouse cortex in vitro, achieving stimulated pulses in accordance with pressure levels. This work represents a step toward the design and use of large-area organic electronic skins with neural-integrated touch feedback for replacement limbs.\n",

Here we report a wireless, real-time pressure monitoring system with passive, flexible, millimetre-scale sensors, scaled down to unprecedented dimensions of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.1 cubic millimeters. This level of dimensional scaling is enabled by novel sensor design and detection schemes, which overcome the operating frequency limits of traditional strategies and exhibit insensitivity to lossy tissue environments. We demonstrate the use of this system to capture human pulse waveforms wirelessly in real time as well as to monitor in vivo intracranial pressure continuously in proof-of-concept mice studies using sensors down to 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 0.1 cubic millimeters. We further introduce printable wireless sensor arrays and show their use in real-time spatial pressure mapping. Looking forward, this technology has broader applications in continuous wireless monitoring of multiple physiological parameters for biomedical research and patient care.",

        "Ying Diao\n\n\n\nBen is an exceptional innovator and an incredibly efficient and devoted researcher. We worked together on developing novel methods for fabricating single-crystalline, solution-processed organic semiconductors at Stanford. I am deeply impressed by his breath of knowledge and creative thinking.  An expert in electrical engineering and microfabrication, he has also gleaned a wealth of knowledge about biomedicine, fluid mechanics, crystal growth, energy materials, to name a few. Ben\u2019s broad interest is certainly not limited to science and technology. His artistic and literary bent transformed our research \u2018by-products\u2019 into a gold prize (2012) in the Science as Art competition, organized by the Materials Research Society. Ben\u2019s creativity is also manifested in communicating concepts and ideas. His work time and time again captures the imagination of the general public (e.g. flexible pressure sensor, self-healing materials etc). Ben is an effective team player and goes the extra mile to help others. I believe Ben will continue to succeed and to inspire as a scientist and an innovator in the path he chooses to take.",
        "Darren Lipomi\n\n\n\nBen is a fantastic scientist and engineer. He is an outstanding practitioner in his home field of electrical engineering, but his multi-disciplinary work benefits from his proficiency in solid-state physics, chemistry, materials science, and biomedical engineering. The success of my work has depended critically on Ben's collaboration. He designed all of the equipment for the electromechanical characterization of soft electronic devices that we make in the Bao Laboratory, and he has an unofficial role as the mentor of the chemists and chemical engineers in the group on the subjects of electronics and electrical engineering. He is always willing to troubleshoot the projects of coworkers, even if he is not directly involved. He is also a gifted communicator, and his interests in subjects outside of science (among them are food, history, and music) augment his technical creativity. In short, I could not more strongly recommend Ben for any position for which he might be considered."
