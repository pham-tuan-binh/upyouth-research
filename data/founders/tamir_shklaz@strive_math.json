Coding is the literacy of the 21st century and Strive is creating the content and platform to make math more joyful and actually applicable to the real world.\n\nStrive Math (YC S21) is a 1:1 tutoring service for 6\u201310th graders that teaches math through coding games and visualizations. For example, when students create the game \"Pong\", they bring algebra and geometry to life by determining how fast the ball moves and at what angle. They also learn coding at the same time.\n\nOur vision is to replace STEM education in schools and universities globally through our unique pedagogy.  Math, physics, biology and economics can all and should all be taught through code because that's how they are actually applied in industry.",
