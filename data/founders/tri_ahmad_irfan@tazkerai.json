    "summary": "Strong engineering & product leader with proven track record in building anything zero to one and scaling them beyond what everybody thought was possible.\n\nCurrently building Lumina to empower 270 million underserved Indonesians to work for a better life. Lumina has secured fundings from Y Combinator & Alpha JWC.\n\nPreviously I help build GudangAda to revolutionize FMCG logistics and supply chain (with $135m+ raised from Sequoia Capital, Falcon Edge, Asia Partners, and Alpha JWC).\n\nPrior to GudangAda, I was part of the founding team at STOQO where I helped built the core products and scaled the engineering team from 1 to 40 in three years. The company raised funding from top VCs in the region (Accel Partners, Monk's Hill Ventures, Insignia Ventures, and Alpha JWC Ventures).\n\nPreviously, I worked at Twitter in San Francisco and several fast-growing startups in Indonesia (GDP Labs, Dekoruma, Cermati). I was a competitive programmer throughout my high school & university years, and coached students who then won medal in national & international levels.\n\nI'm interested in Agriculture, Education, and Economic Empowerment. On the weekend, I'm building Akselito, a coaching platform to help students and fresh graduates build a fulfilling career.\n\nI read classics & works of philosophy as a hobby.",
