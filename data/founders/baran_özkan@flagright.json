Had a great experience with some learnings:\n\n- Focus is key! it's challenging to navigate the errands of running a business with accounting, business development, hiring, legal, etc. while having a full-time job that I also enjoyed. \n- Design thinking works! Go to potential users as early as possible before you build.\n\nCheck out the retired website at https://audiotap.herokuapp.com/, the working app is unpublished and available in prototype on-demand.\n\nAnimated promo of the MMP: https://youtu.be/pdxWRSS65mQ",
