        "Robert Erick Hernandez\n\n\n\nSteven is very detail-oriented to the extent that he makes deadlines and follows up with them. Even from day one, he already made meetings to meet up with me to catch up on the current project, establish goals and organized task through Trello, and was always on time. He is a great person to work with and always is eager to learn more. Expect great things from Steven~"
