        "Lisa Tran\n\n\n\nAldrich and I worked closely together at our overlapping time at Remitly. Aldrich's positive and can do attitude always lent itself well to being welcome to new ideas and new ways of thinking about our product design. As a PM he worked with, it was fun to collaborate with Aldrich. I would start with general requirements about a feature, and Aldrich would take the time/effort to understand the customer's problem and the product goals in order to create potential design ideas. When he had designs to share, he was very open to feedback and questions. And finally, Aldrich always made sure to finalize his work and package it up well so there was an easy handoff/kickoff with devs and others. I appreciated his attention to detail and engagement through the entire design process!  ",
        "Rick Steele\n\n\n\nI had an amazing time working alongside Aldrich as Product Designers. Of his many competencies, two stood out: Organization and Empathy.\n\nIn a world of scatterbrained designer types, Aldrich's conscientiousness and attention to detail were exceptional. Simple things like sharing files, organizing meetings, and keeping projects on track went smoother for his having touched them. He did a great job exploring tons of variations on a product, all the crazy states they could get into, and then presented that depth in a way that was still manageable despite its size.\n\nOn the empathy side, Aldrich was invaluable in our user testing operations. He could speak to our test candidates in their language, put himself in their shoes, and did a fantastic job helping our customers feel confident enough to speak frankly with us about their financial habits, and the accompanying pains -- not an easy thing to do.\n\nThe result was a series of awesome products that both the business and our customers could feel great about. If you're looking for someone to develop or improve your product experience, Aldrich is a great find."
