    "summary": "Blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and other shared ledger technologies are changing the world's financial infrastructure for the better. Financial regulators are now requiring the same level of compliance with anti-money laundering laws as traditional institutions have done.\n\nComplying can be difficult for companies who haven't had to deal with this in the past but is a sign that the technology is maturing and is proving itself.\n\nI have always had a strong interest in financial innovation and believe it is a precursor for real financial inclusion. I have worked in the field for more than 20 years and am really excited by what I believe will happen in the next five years.\n\nMy team at Notabene is bringing our experience in this field as well as our prior work in decentralized identity systems to allow the next generation of financial companies (and smart established ones) to manage regulatory risk.",
