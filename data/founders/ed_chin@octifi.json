Our pioneering use of machine learning in credit underwriting empowered us to provide affordable loans to responsible spenders, culminating in the platform's acquisition by Latitude Financial (latitudefinancial.com.au).  My leadership extended to driving LatitudePay's APAC expansion, managing strategic partnerships, product development and overseeing credit underwriting and risk management. \n\nWith a decade plus in fixed-income credit, trading, and portfolio management, I bring a strong technopreneurial ethos along with hands-on expertise in fundraising, sales, operations, and data science.",
