It was amazing that beyond his skills as a coder, he has a good eye for design. It's admirable how he was able to do all this, while also running a company!\nI highly recommend him for any future endeavours. I would work with him again without hesitation if a chance arises. ",
        "Michael Weinstock Johansson\n\n\n\nI\u00b4m honestly fascinated about how awesomely cool this dude is. Despite being as young as he is, and being a marathon style programmer to boot, Giovanni is still to be seen at every tech-event out there. Hyper-social and always super energetic about his pet startup project, G still finds time to hack away for hours on end at the office and can, like yesterday, still be giving valid feedback on policy that our CTO sets, even though he is half a world away on holiday. Add to that that this guy has just spent the last couple of months sleeping on a pallet in a dorm he shares with three people with only one key and you\u00b4ll get a hint of his level of dedication. If you can hire him, do so, but chances are you won\u00b4t be able to, as he might just be running his own show full time in no time."
